{% newthought "Outside of research, a lot of my time and energy goes into music. The links above detail some of my projects." %} 

I've performed my music at gigs and festivals around Europe, and curated events at venues and galleries around the UK, including Bristol’s Arnolfini Gallery and Southampton’s John Hansard. I've also contributed work to soundtracks for theatre and for art installation. Some of the latter, written for Mark Fisher's [On Vanishing Land]({{site.baseurl}}/music/ovl.html)
 project, was released in 2019 through Hyperdub records.
